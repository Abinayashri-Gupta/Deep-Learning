# Deep Learning Practice Projects

Welcome to my Deep Learning practice repository! This repository contains a collection of Python scripts and Jupyter notebooks (`.ipynb`) that I created while learning and experimenting with various deep learning concepts. Along with the code, I've included datasets used in the projects for easy access and reproducibility.

## Contents

### 1. **Python Scripts**

- Various Python scripts implementing deep learning models and algorithms.
- Each script is self-contained and can be executed independently.
- Some scripts include data preprocessing and model evaluation routines.

### 2. **Jupyter Notebooks**

- Interactive notebooks exploring different deep learning techniques.
- Includes detailed explanations, visualizations, and step-by-step implementations.
- Notebooks cover topics such as neural networks, convolutional networks, recurrent networks, GANs, and more.

### 3. **Datasets**

- Datasets used for training and testing models.
- Included datasets are generally small and suitable for practice purposes.
- External datasets are referenced and instructions on how to obtain them are provided when applicable.

## Setup and Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Abinayashri-Gupta/Deep-Learning
